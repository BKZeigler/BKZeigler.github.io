### CPSC 120

*Lab 3

 Another lab I enjoyed was lab 3. In lab 3, part 2, we were trying to find the value of pizza for a given area and price and used black box testing. I liked doing this because it can easily be applied to real life. Often, many businesses compete for customers, and programs like this can provide who provides the best deal. Still, this doesnâ€™t account for preference on where the pizza came from. Overall, the mass testing that can be done across hundreds and thousands of stores can help people choose an affordable and preferable option. This does not even have to be pizza; it can be anything with a value and amount.

*Lab 9

 One of my favorite labs was lab 9, specifically part 1. In that lab, I learned how to do arithmetic calculations while ignoring some arguments. I enjoyed this part because it dealt with math, and it was really  easy to see how variables served a similar purpose as they did in a math class. In addition, the lab also helped me connect what I learned to how things like a calculator work. Both calculators and the code take 
arguments and apply different operators in order to find an answer. Both shorten the time it takes to solve something compared to if it was done manually.
 
*Lab 11

 Another one of my favorite labs was lab 11, part 2. In that lab, I learned how to use object-orientated programming or OOP. I enjoyed this part of the lab because it involved designing a high/low game which I was  somewhat interested in. I want to focus on game development as a part of my computer science major, and this was one of my very first games. The game was fun to program because it had many different scenarios that  could occur. Someone could guess the number in one, two, or three tries or not guess it at all. The countdown of guesses is similar to the countdown of lives in many platformer games.
